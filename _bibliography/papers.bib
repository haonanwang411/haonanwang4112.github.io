  abstract={In the field of big data analysis, with the help of machine learning algorithm, the traditional mode of data analysis has been changed and the development of data processing and analysis has been promoted. This paper first explains the concepts of machine learning and big data analysis, then introduces the classic concepts and application concepts of three kinds of classical machine learning algorithms, namely naive Bayesian algorithm, K-means algorithm and SVM algorithm, and then discusses the application mode of machine learning algorithm in the emerging stage of big data environment, so as to enhance the value of big data processing. Finally, it looks forward to the big data processing The research trend of machine learning algorithm in this field is analyzed.},
