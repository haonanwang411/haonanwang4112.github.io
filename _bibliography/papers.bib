  abstract={In the field of big data analysis, with the help of machine learning algorithm, the traditional mode of data analysis has been changed and the development of data processing and analysis has been promoted. This paper first explains the concepts of machine learning and big data analysis, then introduces the classic concepts and application concepts of three kinds of classical machine learning algorithms, namely naive Bayesian algorithm, K-means algorithm and SVM algorithm, and then discusses the application mode of machine learning algorithm in the emerging stage of big data environment, so as to enhance the value of big data processing. Finally, it looks forward to the big data processing The research trend of machine learning algorithm in this field is analyzed. }

  abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development of computer information technology, the development of artificial intelligence has been accelerating. The traditional geometry recognition technology is relatively backward and the recognition rate is low. In the face of massive information database, the traditional algorithm model inevitably has the problems of low recognition accuracy and poor performance. Deep learning theory has gradually become a very important part of machine learning. The implementation of convolutional neural network (CNN) reduces the difficulty of graphics generation algorithm. In this paper, using the advantages of lenet-5 architecture sharing weights and feature extraction and classification, the proposed geometric pattern recognition algorithm model is faster in the training data set. By constructing the shared feature parameters of the algorithm model, the cross-entropy loss function is used in the recognition process to improve the generalization of the model and improve the average recognition accuracy of the test data set. }
